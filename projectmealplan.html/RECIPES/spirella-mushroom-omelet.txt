SPIRELLA, MUSHROOM AND ASPARAGUS OMELET

INGREDIENTS:
– 2 Real California Meat and Cheese Spirella Minis*
– 2 eggs
– 2 tablespoons Real California salted butter
– ¼ cup thinly sliced asparagus
– ¼ cup shitake mushrooms
– 1 thinly sliced chive or green onion
DIRECTIONS:
Add 1 tablespoon butter to sauté pan and add mushrooms and asparagus. Cook over medium heat until both are tender and set aside. Vigorously whisk 2 large eggs until no whites are visible. Lightly butter a nonstick sauté pan and place on low to medium heat so the butter does not brown. Add eggs to pan and use circular motion to swirl. When most of the egg mixture is cooked, add 2 California Spirella mini’s, mushrooms and asparagus to the center. Fold over once and then again. Cheese should be melted. Garnish with chives or green onion and serve.

Serves: 1-2

* California Mozzarella Cheese wrapped with Salami, Pepperoni, Sopressata or Prosciutto
