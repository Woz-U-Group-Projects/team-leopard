– 1 cup Real California milk
– 1 cup Real California Cheddar cheese, shredded
– 2 eggs, beaten
– 3 Tbsp Real California butter, melted
– 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
– 1 Tbsp baking powder

– ½ tsp salt
– 8 pieces bacon, cooked and divided
DIRECTIONS:
1. Preheat the waffle iron.

2. In a large bowl, sift flour, baking powder, sugar, salt. Add in the melted California butter, eggs, milk, and combine. Once the batter is mixed, add the grated California Cheddar cheese and 6 pieces of bacon crumbled. Fold in the ingredients until they are incorporated evenly into the batter.
